                    And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. You enjoyed that. We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. The unexpected is our normal routine. and attack the Romulans. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. Damage report! Sorry, Data. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! This is not about revenge. This is about justice. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Well, that's certainly good to know. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. This should be interesting. Your head is not an artifact! Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. I am your worst nightmare! Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Besides, you look good in a dress. They were just sucked into space. Computer, belay that order. Shields up! Rrrrred alert! About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data.

                  <p>
                    Travel time to the nearest starbase? Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion? That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. How long can two people talk about nothing? I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. Ensign Babyface! Talk about going nowhere fast. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. What? We're not at all alike!
