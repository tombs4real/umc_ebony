              The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! What? We're not at all alike! Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? How long can two people talk about nothing? and attack the Romulans. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules.

              Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? The unexpected is our normal routine. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. Besides, you look good in a dress. A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. I'll alert the crew. Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you.
