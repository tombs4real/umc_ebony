              The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! What? We're not at all alike! Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? How long can two people talk about nothing? and attack the Romulans. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules.

              Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? The unexpected is our normal routine. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. Besides, you look good in a dress. A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. I'll alert the crew. Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you.

              We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. The game’s not big enough unless it scares you a little. We know you’re dealing in stolen ore.

              Why are we out here chasing comets? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? I'll alert the crew. What? We're not at all alike! About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Shields up! Rrrrred alert! Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. This should be interesting. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. The unexpected is our normal routine. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh.

            				<p>Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! Sorry, Data. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. I’d like to think that I haven’t changed those things, sir. But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Talk about going nowhere fast. Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Why don’t we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - ‘Commander’?</p>

                    <p>Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. We have a saboteur aboard. What’s a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? I’ve had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. How long can two people talk about nothing? I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. I recommend you don’t fire until you’re within 40,000 kilometers.</p>

                    <p>That might’ve been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. I think you’ve let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. You’re going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. I’ll alert the crew. The Federation’s gone; the Borg is everywhere! In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal.</p>
